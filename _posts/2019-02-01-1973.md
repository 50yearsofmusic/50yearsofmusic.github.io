This classic album, _Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band_ and its iconic track _Whn I'm Sixty Four_ was not published in 1973, but it entered its way onto our family LP player in early seventies and left a strong imprint on me.

My parents had a great record collection that consisted of 45-inch singles (Beatles, Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, and some french singer-songwriters) and about 2 meters of classic music and jazz LP albums in the living room bookshelf. The groovy sixties tracks such as _Love Supreme_ and _Sergeant Pepper_ by the Beatles must have been part of their lifestyle and culture while my mother and father were studying at the University in the sixties. My mother had mainly focussed on classical music before the sixties being an avid piano player herself, but political songs and the contemporary popular music scene was clearly something that was part of the atmosphere in the major Finnish cities among students. 

For me, my record collection pooled together by my parents was a rich and fascinating treasure trove of new worlds; There were African sounds such as the funky album from a band and album called _Osibisa_ (1971), probably just created purely imagined Africa for me by the token of the massive elephants in the LP cover and pervasive conga drum beats in each track. Other LPs invoked a smoky jazz club atmosphere (I remember the stylish logos of the Blue Note Records albums by Miles Davis and John Coltrane). 

Out of the whole record collection, the most spellbinding and evocative album was the one with all those mythical characters that appeared on the red and yellow, vibrant double sleeve album. This album, _Sgt Pepper_ by the Beatles, was already then a classic but I realize only now that the cover itself is considered to be a piece of modern art that defined the era. It had over 60 cultural icons depicted, including Gandhi, Einstein, Oscar Wilde, and Karl Marx although some of the more controversial figures such as Jesus, Hitler and Elvis did not finally make the cut). I did not understand any of the lyrics nor was I clued up to the stories or cultural references of any of this, but the catchy melodies, evocative instrumentations (brass band, sitar, and differently fuzzed and distorted electric guitars) and friendly voices created an auditory scene that transported a pre-school aged me into completely new and colourful worlds that felt and tasted refreshingly new and exotic. I remember loving the actual sounds and textures in the _When I'm Sixty Four_ (mainly created by two clarinets, which later became my own instrument, but I would not underestimate the sound of Paul McCartney's warm and round HÃ¶fner violin bass sound). Few year later when I started to play the clarinet, this was one of the first songs that I picked up by ear with my clarinet.

In my studies of music many years later I actually learned that _When I'm Sixty Four_ was written by Paul McCartney when he was only 15, and that the clarinets (and a bass clarinet and tubular bells) were added to the song in the recording session in 1966 by George Martin in the legendary Abbey Road studios at London. The track was sped up (from C major to Db major) to sound more youthful and upbeat. It certainly captures the bright and charming nature of the lyrics which pose seemingly a lighthearted question about 'will you still feed, will you still feed me'. As we grow old and realize how frail and capricious life can be, the question does appear to take a new meaning to someone who is closer to 50 than 5 or 15. 

This track and the album has made a lasting impact on me, even if you do not read the choice of instrument (clarinet), or field or study (musicology), Master of Arts thesis topic (instrumentation changes over time in the music of the Beatles), or living in the UK into this.
