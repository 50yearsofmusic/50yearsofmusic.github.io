# Lisatietoa

To celebrate 50 years of greatness in music since 1971, Tuomas and I have taken up a challenge to choose a musical track for each week in 2021. We start with a recording / composition from circa 1971 on the first week of 2021 and will end up a yet unpublished track / encounter with an artist in December 2021. We were inspired for this challenge by a librarian friend who read 50 years of childrenâ€™s literature last year.
